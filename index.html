        <h3>Image Reconstruction Approach Based On Autoencoder Model With Attention Mechanism In PAT Imaging</h3>
        <p>• Used autoencoder approach which is generally used for image segmentation approach to reconstruct images with backprojection images as input.</p>
        <p>• Also, embedded attention mechanism called the attention gate at skip connections helps in increasing the quality of reconstruction.</p>
        <p>• Used PSNR and SSIM to access the model performance.</p>
        <p>• Our model outperformed the existing model by 10% in terms of reconstruction quality and similarity index.</p>
